# Dissipative Particle Dynamics
Dissipative Particle Dynamics is a mesoscale coarse-grained fluid dynamics simulation technique.  This software implementation uses MPI to parallelize the calculations.  Includes viscosity determination via Poiseuille Flow and various tests for parameter settings.  This code was used for the parameter optimization project here: [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4930921).  To compile the code, simply run make in the project directory.  An example input file is available, although, as mentioned, the primary purpose of this program was to test and refine parameters for adequate representation of target fluids, and does not have the same features as something designed for more generic purposes.
